**Features**

**Dynamic Signal Timing:** Adjusts traffic light duration based on live traffic density.
**Emergency Vehicle Detection:** Prioritizes green signals for ambulances and fire trucks.
**Sensor Integration:** Supports IR, ultrasonic, or camera-based inputs for vehicle detection.
**Data Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes traffic trends and generates useful insights.
**Modular Architecture:** Easily extendable to support smart city integrations.
